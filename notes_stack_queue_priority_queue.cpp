Stack:
	Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO(Last in first out) principle.
	
	- Stack has one end only.
	- It contains only one pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack.
	
	eg:
		Recursion
		Do and Un-Do mechanism.
		
	Stack Functions:
		1. push(): use to store element in stack.
		2. pop(): use to remove elment from the top of the stack.
		3. top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
		4. empty(): Returnns true if stack is empty otherwise false.
		5. size(): return number of elements of stack.
		


Polish Notation:
	This type of notation was introduced by the Polish mathematician Lukasiewicz. 
	- Polish notation in data structure tells us about different ways to write an 
		arithmetic expression. 
		
	- An arithmetic expression contains 2 things:
		1. Operator:
			Operator is a symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed.
			eg:
				+, -, *, /, ^, %

		
		2. Operand:	
			Operand is a value or a variable on which an opertion is performed by an operator.
			eg:
				0 to 9, a to z, A to Z
	
	
	
	- There are mainly three type of Polish Notation:
		1. Infix notation:
			This polish notation in data structure states that the operator is written 
			in between the operands.
			
			eg:
				( a + b ) x c ( a + b ) x c
				a + b - c + d
				( a x b ) + ( c / d ) ( a x b )
			
			
		2. Prefix notation:
			This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as a
			prefix or before the operands.
			eg:
				  + a b
				  + - a b c + - a b c
				  x a b x a b
			
			
		3. Postfix notation:
			This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as a
			after the operands.
			
			- postfix notation is a computer understandable format.
			
			eg:
				 a b -
				 a b / c d /
				 12 5 + 3 / 12 5 + 3 /
				 8 2 3 x + 8 2 3 x +
	
	
	
	
Queue:
	Queue is a linear data structure that stores the data in First In First Out order.
	eg:
		printing pages in printer.
		downloading files in some application.
		
	- Operations implemented on the queue:
		1. enqueue(): adding an element to the end of the queue.
		2. dequeue(): Removing an element from the front of the queue.
		3. front():	Retrieving the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
		4. rear(): Retrieving the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.
		5. empty(): return true if queue is empty, otherwise it return false.
