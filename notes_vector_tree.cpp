Vector:
	In C++ Dynamic array is implemented using the std::vector container from
	Standard Template Library(STL).
	
	- We can change the sizeof vector during runtime.
	
	Important functions:
		1. push_back():	// push new value at the end of vector.
		2. pop_back();	// pop() out the last element.
		3. size();	// return the number of elements.
		4. empty();	// It return true if vector have no element
		5. clear();	// pop() out all the elemnts of vector
		6. at();	// return the value at index.
		7. front();	// return the value of 0th index element.
		8. back();	// return the value of 1st index element.
		9. begin(); // return the reference of 0th index element
		10. end(); // return the reference of just after last element


Tree:
	Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that consists of nodes connected
	by edges. It is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree
	structure, with root value and subtrees of childrens.
	
	Node: Each element in a tree is called a node. it contains a vlaur or data.
	
	Root: The topmost node in a tree is called the root. 
			- It is the only node that has no parent.
	
	Edge: The connection between two nodes is called an edge.
		
	Child: A node that is directly connected to another node which moving away from the 
				root is called child.
				
	Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes is called a parent.
		
	Leaf:
		A node that does not have any child is called a leaf or terminal node.
		
	Subtree:
	Depth:
	Height:
	Level:


	
# Tree Traversing:
	There are mainly two type of traversing in a tree:
		1. DFS:	Depth-first search it explores as far as possible along each branch 
					before backtracking.
		
		2. BFS: Breadth first search explores neighbors before moving to the next level,
					typically using queue.
	
	In DFS they are of three type:
		1.	Pre-Order Traversal
		2.	In-Order Traversal
		3.	Post-Order Traversal
